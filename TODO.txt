TODO:
-Increase "menu" capability
    -> Something else probably
-Make it so that if a piece can jump an oppenents piece, it will. Checker rules
    state that if a piece can be jumped, it must be jumped.
    -> Built checkForJump(), which returns true if a piece can jump again, and false if it can not.
    ->TODO: Implement a way for a new turn to see if the next player can jump a piece at the start of a turn
        -> Maybe make last moved piece a global variable called previousSpot?

-Eventually add support for kinging(doubling) a piece
-After jumping, go again

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DONE:
-Add support for accepting commands based on the actual checkers board, meaning
    instead of indicating pieces by row and column numbers, have support
    for commands like "B4 to C3".
    -> Added support for lowercase coordinates
-Need to prevent a piece from jumping if some other piece is in the way
-Need to disable moving to a white space
-Increase "menu" capability
    -> Check how many pieces have been jumped
-Make game more turn based -> Add player 1 and player 2 support
