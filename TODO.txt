TODO:
Checkers rules: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkers
Make game more turn based -> Add player 1 and player 2 support
Increase "menu" capability
    -> Check how many pieces have been stolen
    -> Something else probably
Make it so that if a piece can jump an oppenents piece, it will. Checker rules
    state that if a piece can be jumped, it must be jumped.
Eventually add support for kinging(doubling) a piece
