TODO:
Add support for accepting commands based on the actual checkers board, meaning
    instead of indicating pieces by row and column numbers, have support
    for commands like "B4 to C3".
Make game more turn based -> Add player 1 and player 2 support
Increase "menu" capability
    -> Check how many pieces have been stolen
    -> Something else probably
Make it so that if a piece can jump an oppenents piece, it will. Checker rules
    state that if a piece can be jumped, it must be jumped.
Eventually add support for kinging(doubling) a piece
